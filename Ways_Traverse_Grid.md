## Number of Ways to Traverse Grid

### Question
Youâ€™re given two positive integers representing the width and height of a grid-shaped, rectangular graph. Write a function that returns the number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the graph when starting at the top left corner. Each move you take must either go down or right. In other words, you can never move up or left in the graph.

For example, given the graph illustrated below, with width = 2 and height = 3, there are three ways to reach the bottom right corner when starting at the top left corner:

```
 _ _
|_|_|
|_|_|
|_|_|
```
1. Down, Down, Right  
2. Right, Down, Down  
3. Down, Right, Down

Sample Input:
```
width = 4
hieght = 3
```

Sample Output:
```
10
```

### Solution
```
def numberOfWaysToTraverseGraph(width, height):
    return 0
```
O(n) time as we must iterate through the array once\
O(n) space as we create a new array that is the same length as the inputted array\
