# Week 07 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

This week was a good review of the heap data structure.  It is a binary tree that keeps a minimum or maximum value at the root node.  It is usually implemented using an array.

I also spent time this week exploring LinkedIn Learning courses and the resources available through the career center.

## What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will start on sorting algorithms.  I would also like to spend a little bit more time reviewing heaps and there questions.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

No impediments that I see.  I will continue to solve as many problems as I can without looking at answers.

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

My process worked ok this week.  I broke this week up into two study sessions.  Implementing a heap was something that I really stuggled with.  I definitely need to spend some more time with it.  This is the first time I have dealt with a tree data structure in a long time.
