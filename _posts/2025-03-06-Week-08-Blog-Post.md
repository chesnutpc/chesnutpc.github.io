# Week 08 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

This week I spent time reviewing sorting algorithms and attempting to implement them.

## What do you plan to do this week?

I will start work on tries.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

No impediments that I see.  I will continue to solve as many problems as I can without looking at answers.

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I'm feeling a little bit demoralized lately.  I wish I had chosen a more interesting project.
