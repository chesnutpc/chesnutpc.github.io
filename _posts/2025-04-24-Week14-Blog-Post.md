# Week 14 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

Last week I studied dynamic programming and worked problems. It was a good reminder on how closely linked recursion and dynamic programming are.  Dynamic programming is often a more efficient way of solving recursive problems.

## What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will work on Heaps.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

There are no impediments that I see.  

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

This was a better week of studying.  I enjoyed this topic more than most.
