# Week 13 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

Last week I studied recursion. The second problem I worked on was exceedingly difficult for me even though it just to write a function that takes an array of integers and returns all their permutations.

## What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will work on dynamic programming.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

There are no impediments that I see.  

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

This was another tough week.  Recursive problems seem to have a wide range of difficulty.
