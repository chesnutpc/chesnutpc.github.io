# Week 05 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

Last week I worked on questions dealing with stacks.  Below is a summary of the questions.
<ul>
  <li>Max Min Stack: Implement a min max stack in O(1) time</li><br>
  <li>Asteroid Collision: Question that simulates collisions between asteroids</li><br>
  <li>Valid Brackets: Given a string with brackets, ensure they are closed correctly</li><br>
  <li>Largest Number: Given a number, remove a set number of digits that will result in the largest possible number</li><br>
</ul>

This week was a good review of the stack data structure that follows last in first out model.  Many of these questions were surprisingly difficult as the loops could be very involved.

## What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will start on heaps.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

No impediments that I see.  I will continue to solve as many problems as I can without looking at answers.

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

My process worked ok this week.  Doing one massive study session wasn't the most pleasant thing to do, but I had other commitments this week.
