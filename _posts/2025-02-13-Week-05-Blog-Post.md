# Week 05 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

Last week I worked on one more question on strings and completed four questions on arrays.  Below is a summary of the questions.
<ul>
  <li>Run Length Encoding: String compression to represent repeated letters</li><br>
  <li>Two Number Sum: Given a list of integers, find two integers in the list that sum to a target number in O(n) time</li><br>
  <li>Sorted Square Array: Square a sorted array in O(n) time</li><br>
  <li>Transpose Matrix</li><br>
</ul>

I feel like my brain is slowly starting to get better at these problem, and I am relearning things that I had forgotten about Python.  The two number sum problem can be solved in O(n) time if you remember that a set in Python is a hash table; I did not remember this.  I was able to solve all of these question without looking at the answers, but I don't know if I would have realized that two number sum and sorted square array problems could be solved in O(n) time without being told so upfront.

## What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will start on stacks.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

No impediments that I see.  I will continue to solve as many problems as I can without looking at answers.

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

My process worked well this week.  I broke up my studying into two sessions which gave me time to reflect on how useful pointers can be when solving these problems.  I have noticed that the top of my webpage is getting a little clutter with links, so I will try to solve that issue this week in addition to studying stacks.
