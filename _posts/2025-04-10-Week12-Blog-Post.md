# Week 12 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

This week I studied binary search trees and worked on problems.  It was definitely as much of struggle as last week when I worked on binary trees.

## What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will work on recursion.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

There are no impediments that I see.  Hopefully, the work I did on trees prepared me for this section as recursively traversing trees was a strategy that I used.

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

This was a tough week.  I have been very busy at work on a project, and coming home from work exhausted.  Hopefully, next week will slow down and leave me with enough energy to study.
