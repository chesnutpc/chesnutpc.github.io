# Week 10 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

This week I spent time on linked lists.  

## What do you plan to do this week?

I will start work on binary trees.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

No impediments that I see.  I will continue to solve as many problems as I can without looking at answers.

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

This week was more enjoyable than recent weeks. I like the simplicity of the linked list data structure.  I believe binary trees will be a difficult topic and contain difficult questions.  I will watch some YouTube videos to remind me of how they work.
