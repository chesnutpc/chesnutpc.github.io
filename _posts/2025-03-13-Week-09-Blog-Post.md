# Week 09 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

This week I spent time reviewing tries and implemented a suffix trie.  I also worked on the mid-semester project review.

## What do you plan to do this week?

I will start work on linked lists.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

No impediments that I see.  I will continue to solve as many problems as I can without looking at answers.

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

Just slowly cranking away at this project.  I need to stay focused.
