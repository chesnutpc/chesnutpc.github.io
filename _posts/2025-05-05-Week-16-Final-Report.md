Technical Interview Self-Study

### Introduction
My project was to create a detailed study guide for technical coding interviews, with the goal of gaining an understanding of the data structures and algorithms necessary to complete such interviews.  The primary objective was to work my way through various topics from basic structures like strings and arrays to more complex topics like dynamic programming and recursion.  The goal was to both solve problems efficiently, but also to explain the solutions clearly so that I would be able to communicate my solutions effectively during interviews.

### Background
This project was significant to my professional development as it aligned with my goal to transition from finance to software development.  Technical coding interviews are very challenging and anxiety inducing to me.  By preparing for them through structured practice, I hoped to alleviate this stress.  I hoped that this project would also be give me a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction as I worked through solving these “toy” problems that make up technical interviews.

### Methodology
I set out to cover my self-selected topics through weekly study sessions.  I relied mainly on a course offered by algoexpert.com.  Each week, I covered a different topic outlined in the schedule, learning the basic concepts and working practice problems.  I analyzed the problems for both space and time complexity.  Although I had originally planned on creating video explanations, I realized that I did not have the equipment (tablet with stylus) to record such videos.  I instead relied on detailed written explanations in my solutions.

### Results
Throughout the project I achieved incremental proficiency in solving and analyzing coding problems across planned topics including strings, arrays, stacks, heaps, trees, recursion, and dynamic programming.  I regularly documented mu progress by updating my website and adhering to the study schedule.  The website provides sample problems, their solutions, and complexity analysis.  Aside from excluding video explanations, I feel like I met my primary learning and development goals set out at the beginning of the project.

### Reflection
I achieved the project’s goals planned from the beginning by holding weekly study sessions.  The weekly objectives allowed me to manage my time effectively and maintain consistent progress.  The decision to forego video explanations left me more time review necessary concepts and to work example problems.  Reflecting on my approach, setting up a weekly schedule with clear topics to cover was instrumental in the successful completion of this project.

### Conclusion
Completing this project significantly reinforced fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms taught during my time in this program.  The knowledge and skills I have gained should improve my ability to perform well during technical interviews and aid in my transition to a career in software development.  Looking forward, I plan to continue to work through the course on algoexpert.com to further enhance my problem solving ability for technical coding interviews.
