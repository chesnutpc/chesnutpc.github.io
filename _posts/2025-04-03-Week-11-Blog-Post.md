# Week 11 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

This week I studied binary trees and worked on problems.  It was a good review of recursive functions.

## What do you plan to do this week?

I will start work on binary search trees.  Hopefully, the material I covered last week will transfer over to this week's material.

## Are there any impediments in your way?

No impediments that I see.  I will continue to solve as many problems as I can without looking at answers.

## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

This was a tough week.  Trees have always been a hard data structure for me.  I may need to seek out review videos.
