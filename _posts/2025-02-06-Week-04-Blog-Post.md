# Week 04 Blog Post

## What did you do last week?

This week I assessed other students' project proposals and started on my project.  I did run into a few difficulties on my project trying to update the website.  I have never used GitHub pages before and I was unfimiliar with how Jekyll works.  I got stuck trying to create a new static page for the "Strings" section on the study manual.  In particular, I did not know that web browsers did not have built in markdown rendering.  You have to add "front matter" to the markdown file to tell Jekyll to convert it to html.  This was something simple, but it took me a while to figure out.  I then was ready to start answering a couple of example questions on strings.  I first attempted a medium hard problem and realized that it was way too difficult for me.  I think I forgotten a lot concepts learned in data structures in algorithms.  I then switched to two easy questions.  This was still a struggle, but I am trying to answer the questions on my own first before looking at answers.  Even though the questions seem straight forward, answering with optimal time and space complexity is challenging.


## What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will answer at least one more question on strings and then move on to arrrays.  


## Are there any impediments in your way?

I am feeling better about this upcoming week than this past week now that I have a good handle on GitHub pages and Jekyll.


## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

This week was really eye-opening because it showed me just how much I have forgotten and how challenging even medium interview questions are.  I still want to struggle through questions rather than quickly turning to solutions even if I can't get through the number of problems that I would like to.
