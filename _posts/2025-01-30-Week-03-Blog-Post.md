## What did you do last week?

This week I finally settled on my project.  I will create a study guide to prepare for coding interviews.  The bulk of the study guide will be devoted to practice problems, their solutions, and a short video that explains the approach to the question and the solution.  Each week I will focus on a different topic.  I have compiled a list of 14 topics.


## What do you plan to do this week?

This week I will start on the first topic, strings.  If time permits, I will get a jump on the next topic, arrays.  I will also start to set up the website/study guide and figure out which software program I will use to record videos.  I'm leaning towards Camtasia.


## Are there any impediments in your way?

I don't anticipate any.  The main challenge will be my time constraints.  I will have to balance the time I spend in this class with the time I spend in the NLP class.


## Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

I'm just happy that I have settled on a project and that I can now get into a routine.
